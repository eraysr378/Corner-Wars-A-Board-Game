# Corner-Wars-A-Board-Game
This is a board game that I played with my friends when I was a child. <br />
The rules are a few rules and all are simple. <br />
The rules and how to play the game is shown in the video by playing the tutorial. <br />
There are 2 languages available Turkish and English. <br />
It was fun to implement the algorithm and making a tutorial for the players. <br />
Also I have had an opportunity to learn localization for a game. <br />
